                        The Manager is developed and maintained by an independent

                        There are two ways to report issues.<br/>&nbsp;
                        The fastest way is to open the left-side navigation menu, click or tap "Report an Issue or Error" and fill out a short report. This emails the maintainers of the Manager directly and includes information about you and your settlements that makes issues easier to research.<br/>&nbsp;
                        Alternately, if you use GitHub, feel free to open issues in <a href="https://github.com/toconnell/kdm-manager/issues" target="top">the Manager's public repository</a>.

                        When creating a new campaign (or updating an old one), add
                        one of the <i>Echoes of Death</i> or, if you have any of the
                        <i>Echoes of Death</i> expansions in your <b>KD Collection</b>,
                        enable the "Fighting Arts & Disorders" from your collection.
                        <br/>&nbsp;
                        At that point, the appropriate Strain Fighting Arts will be
                        available in the Fighting Arts drop-down on Survivor Sheets
                        for that campaign.<br/>&nbsp;
                        Please note that <i>all Strain Fighting Arts will be

                        No. Selecting the '* Random Fighting Art' option from the
                        drop-down will pick a random Fighting Art from a list that
