            <td colspan="3">
                <p>Private routes require an Authorization header including a
                JWT token.</p>
                <p>(See the documentation above for more info on how to POST
                user credentials to the <code>/login</code> route to get a
                token.)</p>
                <p>Generally speaking, when you access any private route, you 
                want your headers to look like this when using private routes:
                </p>
                <code>
                {
                    'content-type': 'application/json',
                    'Authorization': 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6...'
                }
                </code>
                <p>Finally, keep in mind that tokens are extremely short-lived,
                so you should be prepared to refresh them frequently. See the
                section below on 'Authorization Token Management' for more info
                on checking/refreshing tokens.</p>

            <p> In a nutshell, the basic idea here is that the only required key
            in the JSON you POST to this route is an object ID for the settlement
            to which the survivor belongs:</p>
            <code>{'settlement': '59669ace4af5ca799c968c94'}</code>
            <p> Beyond that, you are free to supply any other attributes of the
            survivor, so long as they comply with the data model for survivors.</p>
            <p> Consult the <a href="/#survivorDataModel">Survivor Data Model (below)</a> for a
            complete reference on what attributes of the survivor may be set at
            creation time.</p>
            <p>As a general piece of advice, it typically makes more sense to
            just initialize a new survivor with defaults and then operate on it
            using the routes below.</p>
            <p><b>Important!</b>Just like the <code>/new/settlement</code> route,
            a successful POST to the <code>/new/survivor</code> route will return
            a serialized version (i.e. JSON) of the new survivor, complete with
            the <code>sheet</code> element, etc.</p>

            <p><b>Settlement Routes:</b> all routes for working directly with a
            settlement follow a <code>/settlement/&lt;action&gt;/&lt;settlement_id&gt;
            </code> convention.</p>
            <p>These routes are private and require authentication.</p>

            <p>Many operations below require asset handles.
            Asset handles may be found in the settlement's <code>game_assets</code>
            element, which contains dictionaries and lists of assets that are
            available to the settlement based on its campaign, expansions, etc.</p>
            <p>Typical settlement JSON looks like this:</p>
            <pre><code>
            {
                "user_assets": {...},
                "meta": {...},
                "sheet": {...},
                "game_assets": {
                    "milestones_options": {...},
                    "campaign": {...},

                },
            }
            </code></pre>

            <p><b>Important!</b> As indicated elsewhere in this documentation,
            asset handles will never change. Asset names are subject to change,
            and, while name-based lookup methods are supported by various routes,
            using names instead of handles is not recommended.</p>
